      The province does not know how many application for a pill press retail store license will be recieved. Therefore,
      it is difficult
      to predict how long applications will take to process. To minimize delays in processing, applicants must make
      sure
      the application is complete before submitting it.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      The ‘save for later’ feature allows applicants to re-access an application in progress. Please be advised that
      once an application
      is submitted you will be unable to upload additional documentation. For questions on the LCRB application process
      please
